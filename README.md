# Facenet-TF
Facenet implementation using Tensorflow 2.x

Using Inception - V3 to find the n-dimensional embeddings which could represent a face such that it is distinguishable from faces of other people. Triplet loss is used to **minimise the intra-class variance** and **increase the inter-class vairance**. Three variations of triplet losses are used which can be found at `src/triplet_loss.py`.

- `Triplet Loss` : A straight-forward procedure which finds triplets by iterating through all triplets formed.
- `Hard Triplet Loss` : A procedure which chooses triplet pairs such that distance b/w -ve and anchor is less and the distance b/w anchor and +ve is more.
- `Adaptive Triplet Loss` : The main idea to correct the triplet selection bias, so we try to minize the distribution shift between the batch and the tripet set.

## Code Organization

1. `train.py`           : Creates a trainer object for maintaing checkpoints, logs, train loop and args.
2. `src/data.py`        : Creates tf.data.dataset from tfrecords in the specified directory.
3. `src/model.py`       : Creates model class which gives embeddings from a image.
4. `src/params.py`      : Creates paramters class from a json in the hyperparameters directory.
5. `src/triplet_loss.py`: Loss functions and loss utility functions for for triplet loss.

### How to run

Train from scratch
```
python train.py --params_dir ./hyperparameters/batch_all.json --data_dir ./data/ 
                --log_dir ./.logs/ --ckpt_dir ./.ckpt/ --restore 0
```

Restore from previous checkpoint
```
python train.py --params_dir --restore 1
```
